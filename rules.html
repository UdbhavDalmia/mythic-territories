      <h2>1. The Objective</h2>
      <p>
        Welcome to Mythic Territories, a game of strategy and conquest. Your goal is to achieve victory in one of two ways:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Vanquish a Rival:</strong> In "Pass and Play," you must outmaneuver a human opponent and capture their leader: the <strong>Ash Tyrant</strong> or <strong>Frost Lord</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Defy a God:</strong> In "Challenge the Architect," you must face the maker of the world itself. Prove that your mortal will can triumph over the flawless, primordial intelligence that forged the realms.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section id="gameplay"><h2>2. Core Gameplay</h2><ul><li><strong>Turns:</strong> Each player moves one piece per turn. A full round consists of both players taking a turn.</li><li><strong>Movement:</strong> Pieces may move one square in any direction, including diagonals.</li><li><strong>Combat:</strong> Moving onto a square occupied by an enemy initiates combat. The piece with the higher <strong>Effective Power</strong> wins. If powers are equal, the player controlling more <strong>Territory</strong> wins.</li><li><strong>Territory:</strong> Moving a piece to an unoccupied square converts it to your territory. This is the tie-breaker in combat.</li></ul></section>
    <section id="the-board"><h2>3. The Battlefield</h2><p>The board itself contains volatile and strategic locations that can turn the tide of war.</p><h3>The Awakened Conduit (Rifts)</h3><ul><li><strong>Forming the Link:</strong> When you occupy both rift zones simultaneously, a <strong>Conduit Link</strong> is formed. The two occupying pieces become <strong>Anchors</strong>.</li><li><strong>Conduit Highway:</strong> While the link is active, any friendly piece adjacent to one Anchor can use its turn to teleport to an empty square adjacent to the other Anchor.</li><li><strong>Anchor Bonuses:</strong> Both Anchors gain <strong>+2 Power</strong>. The top-left Anchor is immune to enemy abilities (<strong>Defensive Ward</strong>), while the bottom-right Anchor gains a one-time <strong>Rift Pulse</strong> ability, which pushes away all adjacent pieces and dazes them for one turn.</li></ul><h3>The Unstable Shrine</h3><ul>
        <li><strong>Charging:</strong> Capturing a piece on a Shrine square grants the attacker a one-time <strong>+1 permanent Power boost</strong> and adds one charge to the Shrine.</li>
        <li><strong>Overload:</strong> After three charges, the Shrine becomes Overloaded. The next piece to enter is <strong>vaporized</strong> by the raw energy! This also unleashes a <strong>Cataclysmic Pulse</strong>: all pieces adjacent to the shrine are <strong>pushed back one square</strong> and become <strong>Dazed for 2 turns</strong>.</li>
    </ul></section>
    <section id="abilities"><h2>4. Special Abilities</h2><p>Many pieces possess unique abilities that consume their turn to use. These abilities have cooldowns, meaning they cannot be used for a set number of turns after activation.</p><h3>Siphoner Abilities (Void Chanter & Rift Warden)</h3><p>The Void Chanter and Rift Warden share the unique <strong>Siphon</strong> ability.</p><ul><li><strong>Siphon:</strong> Use a turn on a Rift or Shrine to gain 1 <strong>Charge</strong> (max 3). These charges can be spent to unleash powerful, faction-specific abilities detailed below.</li></ul><div class="ability-split"><div class="faction-abilities"><h4>Snow Faction Unleash</h4><ul><li><strong>(1) Flash Freeze:</strong> Freezes an enemy piece within 4 squares, preventing it from moving for 2 rounds.</li>
